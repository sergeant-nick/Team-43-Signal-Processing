# Team-43-Signal-Processing
STM32F091 Microprocessor embedded C code for waveform generator, frequency meter, external interrupts, and LCD output.

Uses TIM2, TIM6, DAC, SPI, and external interface.  Some code adapted from Purdue ECE 362 and https://www.engineersgarage.com/how-to-use-an-stm32-microcontroller-to-measure-external-signal-frequencies/
